I studied physics at the Technical University Munich, Germany and finished my Diploma degree in 2011 at the Walther Mei√üner Institut for low temperature physics, where I also continued with my PhD degree. There, I investigated phosphorus donors strongly coupled to a superconducting microwave resonator at millikelvin temperatures. After my PhD, I joined the group of Prof. John Morton at University College London to develop magnetic field resilient, high sensitivity superconducting resonators for ESR applications. I extended their applications further on ferromagnetic material studies, within the group of Prof. Hidekazu Kurebayashi, also at the University College London. Recently, I joined Prof. Chris Kay and Dr. Jon Breeze's research groups to work on room temperature MASER systems.

**Interesting fact** - I did an electrician apprenticeship before my physics study.
