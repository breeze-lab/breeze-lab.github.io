I graduated in Astrophysics from Leeds University, then spent 10 years in industry - first at the UK National Physical Laboratory (NPL) working on cryogenic clocks, then at Matra-Marconi Space / Astrium (now Airbus Space) as a microwave design engineer for spacecraft passive payload equipment.  I returned to academia to do research into microwave absorption in metal-oxides at London South Bank University, then moved to Imperial College London and dabbled in nanophotonics and metamaterials whilst finishing my PhD.  In 2012 I demonstrated the first room-temperature solid-state maser using the organic molecular system photo-excited pentacene:*p*-terphenyl. This maser could only work for a fraction of a millisecond so in 2018 I demonstrated continuous masing using optically-pumped nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond.  In 2019 I was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship and the Henry Moseley Medal and Prize by the Institute of Physics.  In 2021 I took up a faculty position at University College London (UCL) in the Condensed Matter & Materials Physics group in the Department of Physics & Astronomy.

**Interesting fact** - I was a winner of a kids' gameshow on Welsh TV.
