# <i class="fas fa-atom"></i>Welcome to the Maser Lab

The maser lab is located in the [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/) at UCL ([University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk)) and led by [Jonathan Breeze](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/iris-profile-jonathan-breeze).  Our research activities span many areas of condensed matter physics and quantum information science, but our core focus is currently the development and study of room-temperature solid-state masers and cavity quantum electrodynamics.

### Research Areas

* ___Room-temperature solid-state masers___  
* __Solid-state spin-defects__ (qubits) such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centres in diamond and silicon vacancies in silicon carbide  
* __Collective excitations__ *e.g.* magnons, phonons and plasmons  
* __Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED):__ for example, strong-coupling of spin-ensembles to cavity modes  
* __Metamaterials & nanophotonics__
* __Electromagnetic materials:__ dielectrics, ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics  
* __Quantum materials__ & __Materials for quantum technology__
