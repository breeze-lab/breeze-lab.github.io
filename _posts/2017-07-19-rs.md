Our exhibit '[**Amazing Masers**](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2017/summer-science-exhibition/exhibits/amazing-masers/)' exhibit showcased our room-temperature maser, the first time it has been outside a lab. We also encouraged visitors to build pentacene, *p*-terphenyl and other molecules and test drive a robotic mars rover on a CNC machined model of the surface of Mars via a video feed.

Here's our video that explains what masers are, what they do and what they could do:

Thanks to our volunteers we had a very successful week with only a few minor technical hitches.  We hope that our visitors enjoyed the exhibit and learnt about masers and their new exciting future.
