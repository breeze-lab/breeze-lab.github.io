My first day at UCL!

It's been a long tortuous path, but I'm finally a Principal Investigator and I'm delighted to be starting a new chapter at UCL in the Department of Physics & Astronomy.  After 18 months of disruption due to the pandemic, I can't wait to get back in the lab. I'm looking forward to teaching and mentoring young physicists, doing great research and working with awesome colleagues.
