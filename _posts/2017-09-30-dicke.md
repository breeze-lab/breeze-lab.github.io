Our new paper in *npj Quantum Information* on cavity quantum electrodynamics using masers is available free (open access) here:

[Room-temperature cavity quantum electrodynamics with strongly coupled Dicke states](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-017-0041-3)

In this work, we managed to achieve *strong-coupling* at room-temperature with a photo-excited spin-ensemble.  Similar studies have been presented previously with ensembles of paramagnetic ions, but this is the first time an *almost* pure collective quantum state had been initialised.  Of the ~10<sup>15</sup> pentacene molecules, over 90% were prepared in the excited state.

This was a fun paper.  Realising we were operating in the *strong-coupling* regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics, for me, was a milestone.
