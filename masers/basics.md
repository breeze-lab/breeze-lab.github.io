# Introduction

## What are masers?

**MASER** is an acronym for **M**icrowave **A**mplification by **S**timulated **E**mission of **R**adiation.  Masers work in exactly the same way as lasers and in fact predated them by 6 years.  Originally, MASER stood for **Molecular** Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation until 'optical masers' were invented and then renamed LASERS (Light Amplification etc).  Stimulated emission is a quantum process whereby a *photon* (particle of electromagnetic radiation) induces an electron in a higher energy state to drop down into a lower energy state whilst emitting another photon with the energy difference equal to the incoming photon energy and, importantly, the same phase - *i.e.* coherent.  This process is different to *spontaneous emission* where an electron in a higher energy state will randomly drop down into a lower energy ground state, emitting a photon in the process.  Both these process were theoretically discovered by Einstein in 1916 [[1](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916DPhyG..18..318E/abstract)].  

Sustained stimulated emission produces an exponential growth in the number of photons over time if there is a large number of *emitters* - electrons in an excited state (higher energy).  The exponential growth can be explained simply: a single photon stimulates an electron to drop down to the ground state, emitting a coherent photon.  There are now two photons, these stimulate another two photons to be emitted, now we have four.  These four stimulate another four, *etc*, until there is a large number of photons.  Within a real device, photons are sometimes lost or absorbed - if the rate of production of photons by stimulated emission exceeds the rate of loss of photons, then the signal will still increase.  The condition where the rates of production and loss are equal is known as the *threshold*, so if the rate of photon production is greater than the rate of loss, then the device is operating *above threshold*.

The ability to amplify a single photon into a huge number with the same phase (coherence) is why masers can be used as low-noise amplifiers.  They have low intrinsic noise because the rate of spontaneous emission is very low at microwave frequencies.  The superior low-noise amplification performance of masers led to them being used in radio astronomy and deep-space exploration. The fact that stimulated emission is coherent in lasers has been used for many applications such as interferometry, LiDAR (light version of radar) and many, many more.

Here's a video we commissioned for our exhibit at the 2017 Royal Society Summer exhibition that explains what masers can do and how they work.

# Basic theory of MASERs and LASERs

## How do masers and lasers work?

Both maser and lasers operate by the same fundamental principle outlined in the introduction - electrons in excited (higher energy) states are stimulated into dropping down into their ground (lower energy) states by photons and, in the process, emit *identical* photons with the same phase.

Noise is the bane of electronic engineers.  We see it on our TVs and hear it on our mobile phones and our radios.  A recent discovery indicates that there may well be a solution.

In the new world of Big Data, we’re increasingly dependent on accurate, reliable and secure communications. Countries with the best communications infrastructure experience faster rates of economic growth [1].  And the rapidly falling costs of data connections means that the number of services built around connected devices will only increase.

But this rapid growth poses a challenge. The microwave technologies that underpin today’s communications infrastructure – from satellite networks to Bluetooth to 4G – are all susceptible to electromagnetic interference.  We’ve all experienced microwave noise: unexpectedly dropped call, crosstalk and Wi-Fi that grinds to a halt.  As more devices attempt to communicate, this problem will only get worse.

Engineering electronics that are resistant to noise is technically possible but has always been costly. One early promising noise-limiting technology was the maser, discovered by Charles Townes in the 1950s and a sister technology to the laser. However, the MASER has had little widespread technological impact because it was inconvenient to use - only functioning in high magnetic fields, a vacuum and  at temperatures close to absolute zero (-273°C).  It was just too difficult so it was not surprising that Townes and his team turned to LASERs which could operate in the earth’s magnetic field and at room temperature.

We have a discovered a new design for a maser that overcomes these problems [2]. The performance of this new maser is orders of magnitude better than the best competing technology.  The breakthrough means the cost to manufacture and operate masers could be dramatically reduced, paving the way for their widespread integration into telecommunications.

When lasers were invented no one knew exactly how they would be used; yet they are now ubiquitous. Already we can foresee additional applications for the re-engineered maser that include more sensitive medical scanners; chemical sensors for remotely detecting explosives; advanced quantum computer components; and better radio astronomy devices for potentially detecting life on other planets. In the near term, the discovery of a room temperature maser solves a real world challenge. It promises better communications that are resilient to the growing problem of noise in our connected infrastructure.
