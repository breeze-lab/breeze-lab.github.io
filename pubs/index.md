**[Continuous-wave room-temperature diamond maser](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25970)**  
_Jonathan D. Breeze, Enrico Salvadori, Juna Sathian, Neil McN Alford, Christopher W. M. Kay_  
**Nature**, 01 Mar 2018

Room-temperature masers based upon photo-excited triplets in organic molecular crystals, such as pentacene-doped *p*-terphenyl, have poor thermal and mechanical properties and can only operate for short durations typically ~1 ms.  Here we demonstrated a room-temperature maser based on optically-pumped nitrogen–vacancy defect centres in diamond that could operate continuously.

**[Room-temperature solid-state maser](https://doi.org/f36684)**  
_Mark Oxborrow, Jonathan D. Breeze, Neil M. Alford_  
**Nature**, 15 Aug 2012

The maser is the microwave-frequency precursor of the now ubiquitous laser. But it had little technological impact compared with the laser because of inconvenience: masers typically require vacuum and cryogenic-temperature operating conditions. Overcoming these obstacles would pave the way for significant maser-based innovations from molecular biology to medicine, security, radio astronomy and quantum technologies.  Here we demonstrated the first solid-state room-temperature maser, based on an organic molecular crystal of pentacene-doped _p_-terphenyl.
