# Hardware

__Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)__  
In the lab we perform continuous-wave (CW), transient and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on spins using a Bruker EMX spectrometer that has custom-built optimized cavities, an alternate home-built bridge and broadband spectral receiver.  There is optical access for photo-excitation via laser either beam or fibre.  

__Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Optically-Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) and Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)__  
An additional Bruker electromagnet (up to 1 Tesla) is used for custom experiments such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and ferromagnetic resonance.  

__Quantum sensing__  
Using ODMR we can probe a smaller sample volumes, so the magnetic field homogeneity is less important allowing us to use permanent magnets and Helmholtz coils.

__Microwave cavities__  
We build state-of-the-art microwave resonators: from aperiodic Bragg-reflector (photonic crystal) cavities with _Q_-factors of 600,000 at 30 GHz to dielectric resonators with optimized Purcell factors for use in masers, cavity quantum electrodynamics and magnetic resonance.

# Software

To design microwave components (like cavities, resonators etc) we use commercial software (CST Microwave Studio and COMSOL), open-source software (MEEP) and in-house mode-matching codes.  

We use Python, Matlab, Mathematica, Fortran, C++ and Julia programming languages.
